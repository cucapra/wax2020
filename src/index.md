# The 2020 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack

<img src="waxlogo500.jpg" style="max-width: 120px;" class="illus">

Welcome to the 2020 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack (WAX)! WAX is a venue for research focusing on computing with unreliability and inexactness.
It is an [ASPLOS][] workshop, which means its 2020 iteration is "virtual."

Approximate computing is a research direction that asks how computer systems can be made better---faster, more efficient, and less complex---by relaxing the requirement that they be exactly correct. Approximation arises from sources as diverse as sensors, machine learning algorithms, and big data applications. Approximate systems raise questions from across the system stack, from circuits to applications. WAX is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming on all of these topics.
